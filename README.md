# Snake-Drum
Exploration of SDL2

I started this project with the thought of just trying to learn about SDL2 by making a simple Snake game. But as I worked on it I got some other ideas that i thought would be cool to add. Some of those ideas got added some hopefully will be added one day. The one of the ideas that i added was a mode where the game would play back all of your attempts.
